constraints.txt has httpx==0.28.1.

The correct commands for cloud are:
make -f Makefile.poetry lock
make -f Makefile.poetry constraints
make -f Makefile.pipx pip-install-constrained

Or in one step:
make -f Makefile.poetry constraints-lock
make -f Makefile.pipx pip-install-constrained

Also verify after install:
pip show httpx | grep Version
Should show Version: 0.28.1

If it's still showing an older version, you may need to:
pip install --upgrade httpx==0.28.1

Or force reinstall with constraints:
pip install -c constraints.txt --force-reinstall httpx

===

1. Install (Deterministic)
   Use the "constrained" install target to ensure your CI environment matches your locked development environment exactly.

# Installs all dependencies + local packages using versions pinned in constraints.txt

make -f Makefile.pipx pip-install-all-constrained

2. Build (Artifacts)

If you need to produce build artifacts (wheels) for deployment (e.g., to build a Docker image or push to Artifactory):

# Builds standalone wheels for all packages in ./dist_pipx/

make -f Makefile.pipx build-all-standalone

3. Run (Tests/App) To run your test suite or application logic using the installed environment:

# Run tests (assuming pytest is in your dev dependencies)

pytest

# OR execute a command using the Makefile wrapper

make -f Makefile.pipx run PKG=fastapi_apps/main_entry CMD="python -m app.main"

Why not the others?
Makefile.poetry: Great for local dev, but requires installing poetry in CI (slower, more complex).
Makefile.pip: Good fallback, but install-all might drift from your lockfile if requirements.txt is outdated or missing. Makefile.pipx forces the use of constraints.txt.
